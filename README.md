# Movie Recommendation System

## Recommendation System 1 - Two Tower Model

Implements a Two Tower model using TensorFlow Recommenders.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k dataset.

**Steps:**
1. Data Loading: Load the Movielens dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
2. Data Preparation: Prepare user IDs and movie titles vocabularies.
3. Model Definition: Define the Two Tower model architecture with user and movie embedding layers.
4. Task Setup: Set up a retrieval task for recommending movies.
5. Training: Train the Two Tower model on the dataset.
6. Evaluation: Evaluate the model by retrieving top-N recommendations for users.

## Recommendation System 2 - Wide & Deep model

Implements a Wide & Deep model using TensorFlow Recommenders.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k dataset.

**Steps:**
1. Data Loading: Load the Movielens dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
2. Data Preparation: Prepare user IDs and movie titles vocabularies.
3. Model Definition: Define the Wide & Deep model architecture with wide (linear) and deep (neural network) components.
4. Loss Function: Choose an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
5. Training: Train the Wide & Deep model on the dataset.
6. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance in recommending movies.

## Recommendation System 3 - LightFM model

**Description:** Implements a LightFM model using TensorFlow Recommenders.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k dataset.

**Steps:**
1. Data Loading: Load the Movielens dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
2. Data Preparation: Prepare user IDs and movie titles vocabularies.
3. Model Definition: Define the LightFM model with appropriate parameters (e.g., number of components, loss function).
4. Training: Train the LightFM model on the dataset.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model by recommending movies for sample users.
